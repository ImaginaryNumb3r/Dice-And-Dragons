# Dice and Dragons

This library provides a set of classes to model probabilities for games with multiple-faced dice. 
By default, the following type of dice are provided:
 - D4
 - D6
 - D8
 - D12
 - D20
 
The number after the D stands for the number of faces on each die.

Furthermore, this library provides probabilities for the more exotic set of dice which is present in the game "Edge of the The Empire."
